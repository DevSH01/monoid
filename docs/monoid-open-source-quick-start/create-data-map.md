# Map Data

## Create the Data Map

Once you've [connected](connect-data-silos.md) a silo and scanned for data sources, you can annotate the elements of each data source schema.

To do so, navigate to your data source's page and click on the `Data Sources` tab. Click on a source to open up a drop-down menu with each property of the source's schema. Here, you can assign categories, indicate whether a property is a [user identifier](create-user-identifiers), and select a Purpose of Processing (available in our cloud offering).

:::tip
To automate user request fulfillment for a data source, you **must** indicate at least one user identifier among the properties of the source.

## Manage the Data Map

Once you've mapped data source properties, you can access views of your data map tab in `Data Map` on the left sidebar. There, you can filter across silos, sources, and properties to find where user data lives.
