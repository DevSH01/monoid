# A Non-Technical Overview of Monoid

### What is Monoid?

Monoid is an open-source platform for maintaining data privacy requirements across data silos and automating DSR's.

### What is Open-Source, and why is that important?

Being **open-source** means that (almost) all of the code for Monoid is publicly available on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/monoid-privacy/monoid). Monoid still provides top-tier support and advanced features (like teams and owners) through its paid tiers.

Why open-source, then? Simply put, an open-source data privacy solution gets you to **more coverage**, **more quickly**, while being **more private** than other solutions. Let's address each of these points in turn.

#### More Coverage

Automating data privacy and compliance requires integrations with every one of your data silos, from your SaaS tools to your internal data-stores. While most closed-source solutions have a number of integrations, most companies have a significant number of tools with customer data that aren't already supported. This means that getting to full coverage involves filing tickets and back-and-forth with solutions; if you're trying to get an integration with a SaaS tool, it can mean working with the privacy solution *and* the SaaS vendor. Plus, as your data stack and SaaS tools change, so does your need for integration.

Because Monoid is open-source, it's *super* easy to add all the integrations you need to reach full data coverage. We've built our codebase with extensibility in mind, so engineers can add all the integrations they need in just a few hours. Plus, because our repo is public and collaborative, we have an always-growing set of pre-built integrations that gets more comprehensive as our community grows (subject, of course, to our own reviews for safety and correctness).

#### More Quickly

Extensible integrations means that you get the coverage you need, on your own timeline. Furthermore, every one of Monoid's integrations is built with **automation at its core**. That means you can **fully automate** Data Subject Requests instead of having to go through them manually. For example, in one click, you can run the deletion of a specified user's data across every single silo, instead of simply forwarding requests to stakeholders.

#### More Private

When managing privacy requirements for internal data stores, self-hosting minimizes the risks of sharing sensitive data with third-party services. However, most solutions charge hefty fees for hosting on-prem. With an open-source solution, you can maintain a self-hosted version in just a couple of steps, because all of the code is publicly available.
