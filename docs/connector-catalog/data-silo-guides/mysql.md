Connecting to MySQL with Monoid works as it does with most standard tools. To do so, navigate to `Data Silos > New Data Silo` from the left-hand sidebar, and select `MySQL` for the Silo type.

Simply enter the connection credentials for the MySQL DB, and Monoid will attempt to create a connection. If it succeeds, you will be taken to the newly created MySQL silo's page.
