# Overview

Monoid is built around connectors to data silos that contain user data, including both internal (DB's, warehouses, etc.) external (e.g. SaaS apps) data stores. A full Monoid connector is able to automatically scan, query, and delete from a connected silo to fulfill data deletion/export requests and generate compliance reports.

The maintainers and the community are regularly adding new prebuilt connectors to the Open-Source repo. If Monoid is missing a connector you'd like, you can build your own easily using our [guide](category/build-a-connector). Alternatively, you can submit an issue on GitHub and we'll get to it as soon as possible, or sign up for a paid plan to get custom connectors on-demand.

The following page contains guides for setting up each pre-built connector currently in the repo. While we try our best to keep it up-to-date, it is always a work-in-progress and may be missing guides for connectors contributed by the community -- if you can't find a guide, please submit an issue on GitHub and we'll add it ASAP (or feel free to create a PR to add the guide yourself!).
